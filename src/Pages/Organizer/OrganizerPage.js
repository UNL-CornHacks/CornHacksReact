                CornHacks is a huge event with a lot of moving parts: sponsors,
                prizes, food, games, judging, and so much more. If you have an
                interest in hackathons or event planning, think about becoming
                an organizer for the next CornHacks event! We are a dedicated
                group of students that work all year to plan an awesome
                hackathon for hundreds of students. We are always looking to
                expand our team and hear new ideas; we have different teams and
                roles available, so you can help out wherever you fit best.
                Reach out to our current organizers to learn more and{" "}

                The number-crunchers. The sponsorship team works with CornHacks
                sponsors, balances the event budget, and generally makes sure
                CornHacks can keep running with adequate funding. We would not
                be able to put on an event of such a large scale without our
                sponsorship team! The primary role of most sponsorship team members is
                correspondence with sponsors: reaching out to potential
                sponsors, organizing sponsorship tiers, and making sure sponsors
                are properly cared for throughout the event. This team has
                members interested in budgeting and sponsorship, but also loves to
                see people-people who can work with sponsors before and during
                the event.

                The logistics team is the core of the CornHacks team, working to
                ensure that every CornHacks event is properly planned and
                executed. They organize the food, activities, workshops,
                judging, and so much more for our hackathon. We need a strong
                logistics team to make sure our participants are engaged and
                excited! This involves the core activities of a hackathon – team
                formation, keynotes, judging, etc – but also all the fun stuff
                like workshops and games! Those interested in the organization
                of event logistics, scheduling, and coming up with creative
                solutions will be great on this team.

                The marketing team is the public face and voice of the CornHacks
                team. They prepare posters, graphics, and digital marketing to
                show students what CornHacks is all about. They also make all of
                the awesome swag that CornHacks participants and sponsors
                receive during the event! Those interested in digital art,
                graphic design, or the preparation of marketing prose will fit
                right in with our marketing team!
